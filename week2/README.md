# Project 2 - The New York Times

WhatNews is a news article searching application powered by the New York Times Search API.

Time spent: 30 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter a search query that will display a grid of news articles using the thumbnail and headline from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can click on "filter" icon which allows selection of advanced search options to filter articles.
	- An example of a query with filters (begin_date, sort, and news_desk) applied [can be found here](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?begin_date=20160112&sort=oldest&fq=news_desk:(%22Education%22%20%22Health%22)&api-key=227c750bb7714fc39ef1559ef1bd8329). Full details of the API can be found [on this article search README](https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json#/README).
* [] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
	* [x] Begin Date (using a [date picker](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment#displaying-date-or-time-picker-dialogs))
	* [] Sort order (oldest or newest) using a [spinner dropdown](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Working-with-Input-Views#spinners)
	* [] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports) using [checkboxes](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Working-with-Input-Views#checkboxes)
* [] Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results.
* [x] User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser.
* [] User can [scroll down "infinitely"](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView) to continue loading more news articles. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [] Robust error handling, [check if internet is available](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures. 
* [x] Use the [ActionBar SearchView](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Extended-ActionBar-Guide#adding-searchview-to-actionbar) or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText.
* [x] User can [share a link](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Sharing-Content-with-Intents#attach-share-for-a-webview-url) to their friends or email it to themselves.
* [ ] Replace Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight [modal overlay](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment).
* [x] Improve the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring 
* [x] Use the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) with the StaggeredGridLayoutManager to display improve the grid of image results (see [Picasso guide](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Picasso-Library#adjusting-the-image-size-dynamically) too).
* [ ] For different news articles that only have text or have text with thumbnails, use [Heterogenous Layouts](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) with RecyclerView.
* [x] Apply the popular [ButterKnife annotation library](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce view boilerplate.
* [ ] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [x] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ ] Leverage the [data binding support module](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into one or more activity layout templates.
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](https://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [X] Switch to [using retrolambda expressions](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Lambda-Expressions) to cleanup event handling blocks.
* [x] Leverage the popular [GSON library](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* [x] Consume the New York Times API using the popular [Retrofit networking library](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Consuming-APIs-with-Retrofit) instead of Android Async HTTP.
* [x] Replace the embedded WebView with [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Chrome-Custom-Tabs) using a custom action button for sharing.
